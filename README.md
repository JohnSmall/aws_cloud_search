# AwsCloudSearch


## Work in Progress

Spoke developed this library in a short period of time in order to migrate from IndexTank to AwsCloudSearchCloudSearch.
As such, there are a few features that are missing that we would build out over time.

+ Implementation of the configuration API
+ Query builder class
+ Faceting helpers
+ Spec tests that stub our the AWS CloudSearch service
